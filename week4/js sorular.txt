1.Week

Exercise 1: Hello world!

Write a statement, using the console.log() function. Give it a string as an argument. The string should contain the message "Hello world!".

Write 10 statements like these, but in different languages.

For example:

Halo, dunia! // Indonesian
Ciao, mondo! // Italian
Hola, mundo! // Spanish
Using the command line, navigate to your js-exercises folder and type in the following to test your code:

node FILENAME.js
It should show the message Hello world! in 10 different languages.

Solution:

"use strict";
console.log("Hello world!"); // English
console.log("Hallo Wereld!"); // Dutch
console.log("Merhaba dünya!"); // Türkish
console.log("Halo, dunia!"); // Indonesian
console.log("Ciao, mondo!"); // Italian
console.log("Hola, mundo!"); // Spanish
console.log("Bonjour le monde!"); // French
console.log("Привет, мир!"); // Russian
console.log("Hallo Welt!"); // German
console.log("Olá Mundo!"); // Portuguese


Exercise 2: Error debugging

Consider the following code:

console.log('I'm awesome');
Copy the code in your .js file and run it in the command line using node. You will see that you will get a SyntaxError. Correct the mistake.

Hint: the SyntaxError message will give you some indication of what the error might be, but figure out yourself how to correct it!

When done right, it should show the message I'm awesome.

Solution:

"use strict";
console.log("I'm awesome");

Exercise 3: Log the number

Follow the steps. Make sure that each step is written on the line after.

First, declare your variable numberX. Do not initialize it (which means, don't give it a value) yet.
Add a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of x is, like in this example.
Add a console.log statement that logs the value of numberX.
Now initialize your variable numberX with a number (also called an integer in computer science terms).
Next, add a console.log statement that explains what you think the value of numberX is.
Add a console.log statement that logs the value of numberX.

Solution:

"use strict";
let numberX;
console.log("x is not defined yet, but will be 10");
console.log(numberX);
numberX=10;
console.log("I assigned "+numberX+" to numberX");
console.log(numberX);

Exercise 4: Log the string

Follow the steps. Make sure that each step is written on the line after.

Declare a variable myString and assign a string to it. Use your full name, including spaces, as the content for the string.
Write a console.log statement in which you explain in words what you think the value of the string is.
Now console.log the variable myString.
Now reassign to the variable myString a new string.
Just like what you did before write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think will be logged to the console.
Now console.log myString again.

Solution:

"use strict";
let myString="Fatih Erik";
console.log("The value of the myString is "+myString);
console.log(myString);
myString="Esra Erik";
console.log("I reassigned myString as "+myString); 
console.log(myString);

Exercise 5: Round a number and log it

Follow the steps. Make sure that each step is written on the line after.

Declare a variable z and assign the number 7.25 to it.
Write a console.log statement in which you log the value of z.
Declare another variable a that has the value of z but rounded to the nearest integer.
Write a console.log statement in which you log the value of a.
So now we have z and a find a way to compare the two values and store the highest of the two in a new variable.
Write a console.log statement in which you log the value of the highest value.

Solution:

"use strict";
let z=7.25;
console.log("The value of z is "+z);
let a=Math.round(z);
console.log("The value of a is "+a);
let max=Math.max(z,a);
console.log("the highest of a and z is: "+max);


Exercise 6: Log an array of animals

Follow the steps. Make sure that each step is written on the line after.

Declare variable and assign to it an empty array. Make sure that the name of the variable indicates it contains more than 1 item. For example items instead of item.
Write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is.
Write a console.log statement that logs the array.
Create a new variable with an array that has 3 of your favorite animals, each in a different string. Make sure the name of the variables says something about what the variable contains.
Write a console.log statement that logs the second array.
Add a statement that adds another string ("Piglet)" to the array of animals.
Write a console.log statement that logs the second array!

Solution:

"use strict";

let animals=[];
console.log("animals is empty now");
console.log(animals);
let fav_animals=["dog","cat","lion"];
console.log(fav_animals);
fav_animals.push("Piglet");
console.log(fav_animals);

Exercise 7: Log the length of a string

Follow the steps. Make sure that each step is written on the line after.

Declare a variable called mySentence and initialize it with the following string: "Programming is so interesting!".
Figure out (using Google) how to get the length of mySentence.
Write a console.log statement to log the length of mySentence.

Solution:

"use strict";
let mySentence= "Programming is so interesting!";
console.log("Length of mySentence is "+mySentence.length);

Exercise 8: Type checker

Write a program that checks the data types of two variables and logs to the console SAME TYPE if they are the same type. If they are different types log Not the same....

Declare 4 variables: 2 must be strings and 2 must be objects
Create 6 conditional statements, where for each you check if the data type of one variable is the same as the other
Find out how to check the type of a variable
Write 2 console.log statements to log the type of 2 variables, each with a different data type
Now compare the types of your different variables with one another
Log Not the same... when the types are different
Here's an incomplete example of how it could look:

// Declare all variables
let x = 9;
let y = 67;

// Check data type
console.log(...);

// Check if data type is the same
if (...) {
    console.log('SAME TYPE');
}

Solution:

"use strict";

let x = "car";
let y = "truck";

let Volvo = {
    "model":2013
};
let Ford = {
    "model":2015
};

console.log(typeof(x));
console.log(typeof(Volvo));

if(typeof x ===  typeof y){

    console.log("SAME TYPE");
}else{
    console.log("NOT THE SAME");
}
if(typeof x ===  typeof Volvo){
    console.log("SAME TYPE");
}else{
    console.log("NOT THE SAME");
}
if(typeof x ===  typeof Ford){
    console.log("SAME TYPE");
}else{
    console.log("NOT THE SAME");
}
if(typeof y ===  typeof Volvo){
    console.log("SAME TYPE");
}else{
    console.log("NOT THE SAME");
}
if(typeof y ===  typeof Ford){
    console.log("SAME TYPE");
}else{
    console.log("NOT THE SAME");
}
if(typeof Volvo ===  typeof Ford){
    console.log("SAME TYPE");
}else{
    console.log("NOT THE SAME");
}

Exercise 9: Log the remainder

For each of these, write in comments what the answer is followed by how you came to that conclusion

If x equals 7, and the only other statement is x = x % 3, what would be the value of x after the calculation?
If y equals 21, and the only other statement is y = y % 4, what would be the value of y after the calculation?
If z equals 13, and the only other statement is z = z % 2, what would be the value of z after the calculation?

Solution:

"use strict";
let x = 7;
x=x%3;
let y = 21;
y=x%4;
let z = 13;
z=z%2;

console.log(" % operator gives the remainder of the division of two numbers");
console.log(x);
console.log(y);
console.log(z);

Exercise 10: Compare arrays

Declare 2 variables, that each hold an array. The first array should have 4 items, the second 7 items
Find out how to get the length of each array. Write a console.log statement that shows the length of each array
const array = ["hello", 123, true, { name: "Noer" }];

console.log('The length of the array is...' + ...);
Write a conditional statement that checks if both are of equal length. If they are, log to the console They are the same!, if not log Two different sizes

Solution:

let array1=[1,2,3,4]
let array2=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

x=array1.length
y=array2.length

console.log("The length of the arrays are: "+ x+" and "+y);

if(x === y){

    console.log("They are the same!");
}else{
    console.log("Two different sizes");
}
