2. Week

Exercise 1: Remove the comma

Consider the following string:

let myString = "hello,this,is,a,difficult,to,read,sentence";
Add the variable to your file.
Log the length of myString.
The commas make that the sentence is quite hard to read. Find a way to remove the commas from the string and replace them with spaces. (use Google!)
After replacing the commas, log myString to see if you succeeded.

Solution:

"use strict";
let myString = "hello,this,is,a,difficult,to,read,sentence";
let a = myString.length;
console.log(a);
let b = myString.replace(/,/g, " ");
console.log(b);

Exercise 2: The even/odd reporter

Report whether or not a number is odd/even!

Create a for loop, that iterates from 0 to 20.
Create a conditional statement that checks if the value of the counter variable is odd or even.
If it's odd, log to the console The number [PUT_NUMBER_HERE] is odd!.
If it's even, log to the console The number [PUT_NUMBER_HERE] is even!.

Solution:

"use strict";
for (var i = 0; i <= 20; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    console.log("The number is " + i + " even!");
  } else {
    console.log("The number is " + i + " odd!");
  }
}

Exercise 3: The recipe card

Ever wondered how to make a certain meal? Let's create a recipe list with JavaScript!

Declare a variable that holds an empty object literal (your meal recipe).
Give the object 3 properties: a title (string), a servings (number) and an ingredients (array of strings) property.
Log each property out seperately, using a loop (for, while or do/while)
It should look similar to this:

Meal name: Omelete
Serves: 2
Ingredients:
4 eggs
2 strips of bacon
1 tsp salt/pepper

Solution:

"use strict";
var recipe = {
  Meal_name: "Fried Spaghetti Cake",
  Serves: 20,
  Ingredients: [
    "1 spaghetti",
    "4 egg",
    "salt",
    "pepper",
    "vegetable oil",
    "marinara sauce"
  ]
};

for (let item in recipe) {
  console.log(item + " : " + recipe[item]);
}

Exercise 4: The reading list

Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

Declare a variable that holds an array of 3 objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (string), author (string), and alreadyRead (boolean indicating if you read it yet).
Loop through the array of books.
For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".
Create a conditional statement to change the log depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like You already read "The Hobbit" right after the log of the book details
If you haven't read it log a string like You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings"

"use strict";
let books = [
  {
    title: "War and Peace",
    author: "Tolstoy",
    alreadyRead: true
  },
  {
    title: "Zorba",
    author: "Nikos Kazancakis",
    alreadyRead: true
  },
  {
    title: "Divine Comedy",
    author: "Dante",
    alreadyRead: false
  }
];

for (var item in books) {
  console.log(books[item].title + " by " + books[item].author);
}

for (var item in books) {
  if (books[item].alreadyRead === true) {
    console.log(books[item]);
    console.log("You already read " + books[item].title);
  } else {
    console.log("You still need to read " + books[item].title);
  }
}

Exercise 5: Who wants a drink?

You're at a party and you feel thirsty! However, you've got 5 friends who are also in need of a drink. Let's go get them a drink.

Declare a variable that holds an empty array, called drinkTray.
There are 3 different types of drinks:

const drinkTypes = ["cola", "lemonade", "water"];
Create a loop that runs 5 times. On each iteration, push a drink into the drinkTray variable. The drinkTray can only hold at most two instances of the same drink type, for example it can only hold 2 colas, 2 lemonades, 2 waters.
If there are already two instances of a drinkType then start with the next drink in the array.
Your drinkTray should contain 2 cola, 2 lemonade and 1 water.
Log to the console: "Hey guys, I brought a [INSERT VALUES FROM ARRAY]!" (For example: "Hey guys, I brought a cola, cola, lemonade, lemonade, water!")

Solution:

"use strict";

let drinkTray = [];
const drinkTypes = ["cola", "lemonade", "water"];
var i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  drinkTray.push(drinkTypes[i % drinkTypes.length]);
  i++;
}
console.log("Hey guys, I brought a " + drinkTray.sort());

4. PROJECT: Grade calculator

Every week ends with a project you have to build on your own. Instead of getting clear-cut instructions, you'll get a list of criteria that your project needs to measure up to.

In this project you'll write a function that calculates grades, based on the American grading system! Let's say a student did a test and they got a 60 out of 100, this function will:

convert the score into a percentage
calculate what grade corresponds with that percentage, and
shows in the command line the result: the grade and the percentage
In this example this is what we would expect the function to return in the command line:

You got a D (60%)!
When writing the function, make use of the following grade scores:

Grade A (90% - 100%)
Grade B (80% - 89%)
Grade C (70% - 79%)
Grade D (60% - 69%)
Grade E (50% - 59%)
Grade F (0% - 49%)
These are the requirements your project needs to fulfill:

Make a JavaScript file with a name that describes its contents
Use either a switch or if/else statement
Write at least 2 comments that explain to others what a line of code is meant to do
Make the return value of the function a template string, so you can insert variables!
Use node from the command line to test if your code works as expected
Good luck!

Solution:

"use strict";

//this function converts scores to grades

function scoreConverter(score) {
  score = score / 100;

  if (score >= 0 && score <= 0.49) {
    console.log("You got a F (%s%)!", score * 100);
  } else if (score >= 0.5 && score <= 0.59) {
    console.log("You got a E (%s%)!", score * 100);
  } else if (score >= 0.6 && score <= 0.69) {
    console.log("You got a D (%s%)!", score * 100);
  } else if (score >= 0.7 && score <= 0.79) {
    console.log("You got a C (%s%)!", score * 100);
  } else if (score >= 0.8 && score <= 0.89) {
    console.log("You got a B (%s%)!", score * 100);
  } else if (score >= 0.9 && score <= 1) {
    console.log("You got a A (%s%)!", score * 100);
  }
}
// Let us test it if it works
scoreConverter(60);
